RFS stands for Responsive Font-Size and is an easy to use **SCSS-mixin** which **automatically calculates the appropriate font-size** based on the dimensions of the monitor or device.


## Advantages
- Font sizes will **rescale for every screen width**, this prevents long words from being chopped off the screen on mobile devices
- The minimum font size will prevent the font-size from becoming too small so readability can be assured
- **Super easy** to use, no need to define complex configurations for each font-size
- Font sizes of all text elements will always remain in relation with each other

## Instalation
You can use RFS in your project by installing it using a package manager (recommended):

**npm:**

```
$ npm install rfs --save
```

**yarn:**

```
$ yarn add rfs
```

**Bower:**

```
$ bower install rfs --save
```

**Copy/paste (not recommended):**

You can download the RFS SCSS-file and save it in your `scss/` directory. This
method is not recommended because you lose the ability to easily and quickly
manage and update RFS as a dependency.


## Usage
This input (SCSS):
```scss
.title {
  @include rfs(62);
}
```

Will generate this (CSS):
```css
.title {
  font-size: 62px;
}

@media (max-width: 1200px) {
  .title {
    font-size: calc(23.6px + 3.2vw);
  }
}
```
In this case a value without unit was passed to RFS (`62`), which is interpreted as `62px`. It's also possible to pass
font-sizes in rem-units.


## Configuration

![RFS visualisation](https://i.imgur.com/9t4gAzE.png)

There are configuration variables which influence the calculation of the font size. In the graph above, `$rfs-minimum-font-size` is set to `14px`, `$rfs-breakpoint` is set to `1200px`, and `$rfs-factor` is set to `5`, this is the default configuration.

**$rfs-minimum-font-size:** (in `px` or `rem`)  
Font sizes which are calculated by RFS will never be lower than this size.
However, you can still pass a smaller font size to RFS, but then RFS won't dynamically scale this font size. For example (see graph above): `rfs(19)` will trigger dynamic rescaling, with `rfs(10)` it will just stay `10px` all the time.  
*Default value: `14px`*

**$rfs-minimum-font-size-unit:** (string)  
The font size will be rendered in this unit. Possible units are `px` and `rem`.   
*Default value: `px`*

**$rfs-breakpoint:** (in `px`, `em` or `rem`)  
Above this breakpoint, the font size will be equal to the font size you passed to the mixin; below the breakpoint, the font will dynamically scale.    
*Default value: `1200px`*

**$rfs-breakpoint-unit:** (string)  
The width of `$rfs-breakpoint` will be rendered in this unit. Possible units are `px`, `em` and `rem`.  
*Default value: `px`*

**$rfs-factor:** (number)  
This value determines the strength of font size resizing. The higher `$rfs-factor`, the less difference there is between font sizes on small screens. The lower `$rfs-factor`, the less influence RFS has, which results in bigger font sizes for small screens. If `$rfs-factor` is set to 1, there wouldnâ€™t be any difference at all. 1 is the lowest possible value.  
*Default value: `5`*

**$rfs-two-dimensional** (Boolean)  
Enabling the two dimensional media queries will determine the font size based on the smallest side of the screen with `vmin`. This prevents the font size from changing if the device toggles between portrait and landscape mode.  
*Default value: `false`*

## Do's and don'ts
- Remember to set rfs on your font-size of your `html` or `body`, otherwise some text may not dynamically rescale
- Always set your line-heights relative (in `em` or unitless)
